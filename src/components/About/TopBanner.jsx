            <p>
                We are a hyperlocal platform to connect the waste producers to the
                waste collectors. Individuals, households, organisations, and
                dealers like Kabadiwalas, collectors, and recyclers all come
                together on a unified online platform. Here, a customer can easily
                find their nearest Kabadiwala and place an order for doorstep waste
                pickup.
            </p>
            <p>
                By leveraging AI, IoT, and IT in the waste management sector, We aim
                to help small local Kabadiwalas grow their businesses with the help
                of technology. By offering a modern solution to treat & manage
                waste, we enable our partners to collect waste efficiently with
                fewer resources.
